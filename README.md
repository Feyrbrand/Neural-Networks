# Neural-Networks
neural networks in python from scratch

- ``2_layer_network``:  - build using only ``Python 3.xx``
                        - library ``numpy``
                        - library ``time``
                        - used to train a network to predict XOR values, trained to compute them by himself
                        
- work in progress
